Use Machine Learning for prediction of delivery duration

ðŸš€ Day 18 of My Daily Project Challenge: Predicting Delivery Duration with Machine Learning! ðŸš€

Thrilled to share my latest project: Delivery Duration Prediction! This machine learning project aims to predict delivery times for various delivery apps such as Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit, Zepto, ONDC, DoorDash, and UberEats. By leveraging multiple machine learning models and thorough data preparation, this project provides accurate delivery time predictions, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Models: Implemented six models including Linear Model, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGB Regression, LGBM Regressor, and MLP Regressor. The Linear Model and LGBM Regressor proved to be the most suitable.
Data Preparation: Employed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for model preparation, addressing collinearity and removing redundancies.
Advanced Techniques: Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and multicollinearity, along with feature selection for optimal model performance.
Wide Applicability: Can be used by any delivery app to predict delivery durations, making it a valuable tool for improving delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction.
This project is a great example of how data science and machine learning can be applied to real-world problems, providing actionable insights and solutions.
